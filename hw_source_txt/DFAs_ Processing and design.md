# DFAs: Processing and design


:::warning
**Exercise 1 (Word processing with DFAs).**

1. Consider the following DFAs $\mathcal A_1$ and $\mathcal A_2$: 
![aut_a1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkD7CQiYJe.jpg)
![aut_a2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk0mRmjYJg.jpg)
Which of the following words are accepted/refused by $\mathcal A_1$ and $\mathcal A_2$, respectively? Complete the table.
       

| $w$ | accepted by $\mathcal A_1$? | accepted by $\mathcal A_2$? |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| $aaa$     |      |      |
| $aab$     |      |      |
| $aba$     |      |      |
| $abb$     |      |      |
| $baa$     |      |      |
| $bab$     |      |      |
| $bba$     |      |      |
| $bbb$     |      |      |

2. More generally, can you completely describe the languages $L(\mathcal A_k)$ accepted by $\mathcal A_k$, for $k=1,2$?

**Exercise 2 (Designing DFAs).**

1. Design DFAs whose accepted languages are given as follows:
    1. all the words that end with $ab$
    2. all the words that contain $aba$
    3. all the words that contain an odd number of $a$s and an odd number of $b$s
    4. all the words that contain an even number of $a$s and an odd number of $b$s
    5. all the words such that any three consecutive characters contain at least one $a$
    6. all the words that contain $bbb$

3. What do you notice when comparing the various automata?
